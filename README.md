## TASTERIZE - shareable tasting notes

This is going to be a very simple whiskey tasting notes journal platform. I'm a bartender and whiskey collector switching over to web development and I've always wanted an app where I could take down tasting notes in a quick and convenient way. Whiskey is an expensive hobby to get into and is also very subjective. There is a lot of value in finding someone who likes similiar things to you so you can recommend each other new ones to try. I've been learning web development passively for years now, but I'm looking to make the leap in careers. The idea of building something I would actually use is really exciting to me and I think I could learn a ton doing it!
